# N-bit-ring-counter
A twisted ring counter, also called switch-tail ring counter, walking ring counter, 
Johnson counter, or MÃ¶bius counter, connects the complement of the output of the 
last shift register to the input of the first register and circulates a stream of ones followed by zeros around the ring.
